# IMPORTANT: 

To make youtube videos or google maps work in the app, make sure you add your own API Keys in src\AndroidStudioProject\app\src\main\assets\APIs\api_sample.json. After adding your keys, rename the file to "api.json" and launch the app.

The Quizz section in the app might give you unrelated questions to the subject. It is because I am using a quizz API which does not provide questions about all the categories my team chose to put, so it will give you random trivia questions.
 

It's a simple app, enjoy!
