## IMPORTANT: To make youtube videos or google maps work in the app, make sure you add your own API Keys in src\AndroidStudioProject\app\src\main\assets\APIs\api_sample.json. After adding your keys, rename the file to "api.json" and launch the app.
 
 # The app is made by a team of 2 students with the help of a teacher.
 
 # The Quizz section in the app might give you unrelated questions to the subject. It is because we are using a quizz API which does not provide questions about all the categories we chose to put, so it will give you random trivia questions.
